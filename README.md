# CTKEasyEditor

An easy GUI editor for CustomTkinter in Python - think of it as a boilerplate generation tool for your CustomTkinter projects. Simply arrange elements, change their properties, and then export to a .py file ready to code in!

Thanks to Tom Schimansky for their CustomTkinter development. Find the original page for CustomTkinter here: https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/
The original documentation on CustomTkinter is excellent, and I recommend it for anyone starting off and struggling with the usage of this tool.
Also thanks to Akascapes for providing the CTkColorMenu widget and CTkMenuBar widget.

Note this is still a work in progress:

This tool is still in development, please report any bugs or issues under the issues tab.
Right now it seems to work okay, and the current implementation includes:

- **Latest Update**:
  - Fixed a bug with the widgets' masters being exported incorrectly if the parent was the root element.
  - Added the ability to change widgets' parents on the fly.
  - Improved snapping capabilities even further
  - Made window dynamically resizable.

- Easy Application Window Settings Management
- Easy Active Widgets manager
- Dragging and snapping of widgets
- Widget Editing
- Use of Built In Themes for CTK
- Export to OOP and Procedural files
- Preference Handler (i.e. names of modules, root element, etc)
- Saving and opening of projects
- Change widgets' parents on the fly!

To be implemented soon:

- Custom Theme Support
- Some widgets don't play nice currently, namely CTkScrollableFrame, CTkTreeView and CTkSegmentedButton. I'll add these when I can get them to a stable version and playing nice.

Hotkeys & Shortcuts:

- CTRL --> Hold while dragging to prevent widget from snapping into place
- Shift --> Enforce Snapping on Grid / Center lines only
- ALT --> Only snap widget to other widgets, not the app center lines
- Double Click --> Opens editor window on that widget
- Right Click --> Opens context menu on widget (edit, duplicate, delete)

- The standard save, save as and open hotkeys, i.e. ctrl+s, ctrl+shift+s, ctrl+o, etc
- Control G --> Open the grid aligner
- Control + arrow keys --> Adjust the grid size
- Control R --> Toggle Window Size Adjustability
